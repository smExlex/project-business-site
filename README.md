# Business Site

The assignment was to create a landing page for a business using html Forms.

## The problem

Teamwork with Emmy Dieden, Julia Holm, Vera Witting and myself. We were mob programming for the first time.

We started out with brainstorming and a basic design in figma. The goal was to create a site with a form for ordering oranges in different forms.

The goal was to use Forms so that's what we started out with. We got to use our new skills from our previous project, like flexbox. We could even post to a server

We didn't quite get to do everything we wanted to. If we had more time we would use it on our CSS. The form is working, but it could look prettier. Also, we wanted to put in a "quantity" box after every orange product.
